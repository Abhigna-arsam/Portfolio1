                <h3>Control the Controllables — The Rest, Leave to Mahadev</h3>
                <p>In a world full of uncertainties, we often stress over things beyond our control. But what if we
                    focused our energy on what we can influence?

                    In this article, I share my thoughts on staying resilient, managing setbacks, and building a mindset that helps in both personal and professional growth—whether it’s coding, career prep, or life itself.</p>

                    Prioritize happiness like a priority queue and store moments like DP for future strength.

                <h3>Studio Ghibli Meets AI: A Whimsical Fusion or a Privacy Puzzle?</h3>
                <p>AI tools recreating Studio Ghibli-style art spark creativity and nostalgia, blending tech with tradition.
                    They offer new ways to imagine but raise concerns about originality and honoring hand-drawn mastery.
                    While embracing innovation, we must respect the soulful artistry of legends like Miyazaki.
                    Creativity with AI should carry gratitude, preserving the spirit of the works that inspire us.</p>
